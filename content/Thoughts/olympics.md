Yesterday, I was off sick from work. Among napping and shielding my eyes from light sensitivity, Iâ€™ve been snatching glimpses of the BBC Olympics coverage where I can.

The thing that strikes me so much about the Olympics is how every moment is so enthralling. There are stories everywhere to sink into. From refugee athletes who have fled their home country due to war or persecution, to former world champions recovering from injury to recover former glory. There are so many stories playing out on this stage. 

All of these stories are of course bronzed in incredible sporting achievement. Only today I have witnessed two world records being broken. Not to mention an uncountable amount of personal and season best records accomplished.

What makes the Olympics so easy to sink into is how every athlete competing in each event is at that moment having, if not the best or worst, at least the most important moment of their lives. They have bled for this instant.

Will the rest of us have moments on our own personal trajectories as important as those? I suppose it comes down to ourselves to create those.
