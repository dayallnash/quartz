title: Science Fiction

I love reading science fiction novels. It's the thing that I read every night before going to sleep. I try to read at least 5 pages a night before sleeping. It's often a lot more, but I've got to a point now where I have conditioned myself to be able to read my 5 page quota and then immediately fall asleep if I want to. I could probably read 5 pages at any time during the day and then sleep!

## Hyperion Cantos by [[Dan Simmons]]

5 stars! Really great books, with a great mixture of the literary and science fiction genres.
