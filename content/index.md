# I'm not sure what this actually will be

But I'm going to go ahead and work on it anyway. 

I think the first step is to just keep writing. Writing words. Writing code. Writing whatever I can think of.

It needs to be organised in a good way, which [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) will let me do nicely. I'm following the [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) principles. I sow the seeds by writing, and then I tend to it to let it grow by organising everything properly. In the end, I should have a [second brain](https://petermeglis.com/blog/unlock-your-brains-potential-a-beginners-guide-to-obsidian-and-building-a-second-brain/) which I can refer to - leaving my actual brain leaner; able to work on problems creatively instead of juggling life anxieties and work stresses.
